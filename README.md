Input Names: Users input the names of students or individuals into a textarea. Names should be separated by commas, like this: "Alice, Bob, Cindy."

Grouping Mode: Users can choose from three different grouping modes using a dropdown menu:

"Number of Groups": Divide the students into a specified number of groups.
"Number of People": Divide the students into groups with a specified number of individuals in each group.
"Custom Number of People": Divide the students into groups with custom sizes specified by the user.
Additional Grouping Rules: Users have the option to set additional grouping rules:

"Those people have to be in the same group": Users can specify pairs of people who must be in the same group by separating the pairs with semicolons, like this: "Alice, Bob; Eve, Frank."
"Those people cannot be in the same group": Users can specify pairs of people who cannot be in the same group using a similar format.
Generate Groups: After entering names, selecting a grouping mode, and setting rules, users click the "start grouping" button. The program then generates groups based on the chosen criteria and displays the results.
